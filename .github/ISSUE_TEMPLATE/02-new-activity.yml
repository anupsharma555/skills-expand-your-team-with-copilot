        ## For developers and Copilot coding agents:
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] New activity is added to the database with all provided information
        - [ ] Activity appears in the activities list on the frontend
        - [ ] Activity can be filtered by category and day on the frontend
        - [ ] Students can successfully register for the new activity
        - [ ] Activity displays all correct information (time, location, teacher, etc.)
        - [ ] Participant count tracking works correctly
        
        **Implementation Hints:**
        - Add the new activity to the `activities_collection` in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Follow the existing activity data structure with fields: name, description, category, schedule_details, location, teacher, max_participants, participants
        - Ensure schedule_details includes days array, start_time, and end_time
        - Test that the frontend properly displays the new activity
        - Verify filtering and search functionality works with the new activity
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - Activities are stored in MongoDB with the activity name as the `_id`
        - The `schedule_details` field should contain: `{"days": ["Monday", "Wednesday"], "start_time": "15:30", "end_time": "17:00"}`
        - The `participants` field starts as an empty array `[]`
        - Frontend JavaScript automatically fetches and displays all activities
        - Categories must match the filter buttons: sports, arts, academic, community, technology
