      label: What's currently difficult or confusing?
      description: Describe what makes the current interface hard to use or understand.
      placeholder: |
        Example: The activity cards are too small on mobile phones, making it hard for students to read the activity details and click the registration button. The text gets cut off and students have to scroll horizontally to see everything.

        ## For developers and Copilot coding agents:
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] UI improvements address the specific usability issues described
        - [ ] Changes work well across different screen sizes and devices
        - [ ] Interface remains intuitive and easy to navigate
        - [ ] Accessibility standards are improved (WCAG 2.1 guidelines)
        - [ ] Visual design is consistent throughout the application
        - [ ] No existing functionality is broken by the changes
        - [ ] Improvements are tested on mobile devices and desktop
        
        **Implementation Hints:**
        - Focus on CSS improvements in `src/static/styles.css`
        - Implement responsive design using CSS media queries
        - Consider CSS Grid or Flexbox for better layouts
        - Improve color contrast ratios for accessibility
        - Add focus indicators for keyboard navigation
        - Use relative units (rem, em, %) for better scaling
        - Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
        - Consider touch target sizes (minimum 44px for mobile)
        
        **Technical Context:**
        - Current CSS is in `src/static/styles.css`
        - HTML structure is in `src/static/index.html`
        - JavaScript interactions are in `src/static/app.js`
        - No CSS frameworks are currently used (vanilla CSS)
        - Design should work without JavaScript for basic functionality
        - Maintain compatibility with common browsers
        
        **Accessibility Guidelines:**
        - Minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
        - Touch targets should be at least 44x44 pixels
        - Text should be readable at 200% zoom
        - All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
        - Use semantic HTML elements where possible
        - Provide alternative text for any images
        - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
        
        **Responsive Design Priorities:**
        - Mobile-first approach (design for small screens first)
        - Breakpoints around 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)
        - Ensure touch-friendly interface on mobile devices
        - Stack content vertically on narrow screens
        - Make buttons and links appropriately sized for touch
